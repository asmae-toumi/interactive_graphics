## Usefulness in a data science workflow

### Exploratory work:

```{r echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/atoumi/Desktop/Graphics/figs/explore.png")
```

### Expository work:

```{r echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/atoumi/Desktop/Graphics/figs/expository.png")
```

Share-able, portable, composable (i.e., reports, dashboards, etc)

# Grammar of graphics 

- Leland Wilkinson (1980): A grammar of graphics is a **framework** which follows a **layered approach** to describe and construct visualizations or graphics in a **structured manner**. 


```{r echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/atoumi/Desktop/Graphics/figs/leland.jpg")
```


```{r echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/atoumi/Desktop/Graphics/figs/grammar_graphics.png")
```

Many libraries abide by this grammar: `ggplot2`, `plotly`, `D3` and many others. 

### Grammar of graphics and ggplot2

The **gg** in **ggplot2** stands for **G**rammar of **G**raphics.

> "The transferrable skills from ggplot2 are not the idiosyncracies of plotting syntax, but a powerful way of thinking about visualisation, as a way of mapping between variables and the visual properties of geometric objects that you can perceive."
>
> `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Hadley Wickham')`


```{r echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/atoumi/Desktop/Graphics/figs/grammar_R.png")
```

### Advantages

- Functional data visualization
  - Clean and wrangle data 
  - Map data to visual elements
  - Tweak scales, guides, axis, labels and theme 
- Ease of iteration 
- Ease in maintaining consistency


## Prepare your system

1. Update R and RStudio to the latest, released version:  https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

2. Download and load the following packages:

```{r eval = F}
install.packages(c("devtools", "knitr", 
                   "usethis", "tidyverse", 
                   "plotly", "r2d3", 
                   "crosstalk", "shiny", 
                   "flexdashboard"))
```

Data source: espnscraperR, which collects or scrapes QBR, NFL standings, and stats from ESPN

```{r eval = F}
remotes::install_github("jthomasmock/espnscrapeR")
```

```{r warning = F, message = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(espnscrapeR)

nfl_qbr <- 
  crossing(season = 2020, week = 1:6) %>% 
  pmap_dfr(espnscrapeR::get_nfl_qbr)
```

Consider working in the preview version of RStudio as well for latest features (that are more stable than the daily build): https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/

## Plotly 

- **Plotly** R package allows you to create a variety of interactive graphics 

- Two ways:
  - transforming a *ggplot2* object into a *plotly* object via `ggplotly()`
  - directly initializing a *plotly* object with `plot_ly()`, `plot_geo()` or `plot_mapbox()`
  
- There are strengths, weaknesses to either approach

- Learning both will pay dividends, as they share a common grammar and can be reused 

### Intro to **ggplotly()**

```{r warning = F, message = F}
library(plotly)

nfl_qbr_plot <- nfl_qbr %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = total_epa, y = qbr_total, label = short_name)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_label() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "EPA", y = "QBR", 
    title = "EPA is correlated with QBR"
    )

nfl_qbr_plot
```

```{r warning = F, message = F}
ggplotly(nfl_qbr_plot)
```


### Intro to **plot_ly()**

- Any plot made with  `plot_ly()` uses the JavaScript library **plotly.js**

- `plot_ly()` interfaced directly with plotly.js

- `plot_ly` has arguments that fit into the "Grammar of Graphics":
  - `x`, `y` 
  - `color`, `stroke`, `span`, `symbol`, `linetype`

* There is a family of `add_*` functions:
  * `add_lines()`
  * `add_bars`
  * `add_histogram2d()`
  * `add_contour`
  * `add_boxplot`
  * ...and many more!

The **plotly** package takes a pure functional approach to a layered grammar of graphics, meaning (almost) every function anticipates a plotly object as input to it’s first argument and returns a modified version of that plotly object.

Example: the layout() function anticipates a plotly object in it’s first argument and its other arguments add and/or modify various layout components of that object (e.g., the title):

```{r warning = F, message = F}
layout(
  plot_ly(nfl_qbr %>% filter(game_week == 3), x = ~short_name, y = ~total_epa, color = ~rank),
  title = "QB Total EPA for Week 3"
)
```

Notice that data manipulation verbs from the dplyr package (such as `filter()`) can be used to transform the data underlying a plotly object!

Or, in a more cleaner fashion:

```{r warning = F, message = F}
nfl_qbr %>% 
  filter(game_week == 3) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~short_name, y = ~total_epa, color = ~rank) %>% 
  add_bars() 
```


You can also add a layer of text using the summarized counts. Note that the global x mapping, as well as the other mappings local to this text layer (text and y), reflect data values from step 3:


```{r warning = F, message = F}
nfl_qbr %>% 
  filter(game_week == 3) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~short_name, y = ~total_epa, color = ~rank) %>% 
  add_bars() %>% 
  add_text(
    text = ~team,
    textposition = "top middle",
    cliponaxis = F
  )
```




To recap:

1. Globally assign `short_name`,`total_epa`, `rank` to `x`, `y` and `color`, respectively 
2. Add a bars layer (which inherits the y from `plot_ly`)
3. Use **dplyr** verbs to modify the data underlying the **plotly** object 
4. Add additional layers (like a layer of text)
5. Share 

## D3 and Leaflet 

**D3** and **Leaflet** are also two popular JavaScript libraries whose R interfaces is based on the grammar of graphics. Like **plotly**, **D3** and **Leaflet** can be used in a data pipeline with other R tools to clean, wrangle, transform and model with consistency and ease of iteration. 

### D3

The amazing dreamRs team is behind the {r2d3maps} package which allows you to make D3 maps in a flash. Check out their documentation to get a taste of what you can make: https://github.com/dreamRs/r2d3maps. 

```{r warning = F, message = F}

# Packages ----------------------------------------------------------------
library(janitor)
library(albersusa)
library(sf)
library(tigris)
library(r2d3maps)
library(rmapshaper)

# County geometries -------------------------------------------------------

cty_sf <- counties_sf("longlat") # from albersusa package 
plot(st_geometry(cty_sf)) # checking geometries, looks good
cty_sf <- ms_simplify(cty_sf) # make the geometries simpler for faster rendering 


# Data ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# CDC's social vulnerability index variables: https://svi.cdc.gov/Documents/Data/2018_SVI_Data/SVI2018Documentation.pdf

svi <- read_csv("/Users/atoumi/Desktop/interactive_graphics/svi_county.csv") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% # make everything snake_case
  filter(across(where(is.numeric), ~. >= 0)) # because NA's are coded as -Inf

# join data to geometries
cty_sf_joined <- cty_sf %>% geo_join(svi, by_sp = "fips", by_df = "fips")

# make d3 map
d3_map(shape = cty_sf_joined, projection = "Albers") %>%
  add_labs(caption = "Viz: Asmae Toumi | Data: CDC") %>% 
  add_continuous_breaks(var = "rpl_theme1", palette = "Reds") %>%
  add_legend(title = "Socioeconomic Vulnerability (percentile)") %>%
  add_tooltip("<b>{location}</b>: {rpl_theme1}")
```



### Leaflet 

Like **plotly**, **leaflet** has an R interface. Unlike **D3**, **Leaflet** is more suited for maps. Leaflet is well-suited for the web, highly customizable and integrates well with R's ecosystem. 

```{r warning = F, message = F}
library(tigris)

cty <- counties(cb = TRUE, resolution = "20m") %>% rename(fips = GEOID)

library(tidycensus)

us_county_income <- 
  get_acs(geography = "county", variables = "B19013_001") %>% 
  select(fips = GEOID, name = NAME, income = "estimate") %>% 
  drop_na()

cty <- cty %>% 
  geo_join(us_county_income, by_df = "fips", by_sp = "fips")

library(leaflet)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(htmltools)

pal <- colorNumeric("YlOrRd", domain = cty$income)

labels <- 
  sprintf(
    "<strong>%s</strong><br/> Income: %s $",
    cty$name, cty$income) %>% 
  lapply(htmltools::HTML)

leaflet(cty) %>%
  setView(-96, 37.8, 4) %>%
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.PositronNoLabels") %>%
  addPolygons(
    fillColor = ~pal(income), 
    weight = 1,
    opacity = 1,
    color = "white",
    fillOpacity = 0.7,
    highlight = highlightOptions(
      weight = 2,
      color = "#666",
      fillOpacity = 0.7,
      bringToFront = TRUE),
    label = labels,
    labelOptions = labelOptions(
      style = list("font-weight" = "normal"),
      textsize = "15px",
      direction = "auto")) %>%
  addLegend(pal = pal,
            values = cty$income,
            position = "bottomright",
            title = "Income (5-year ACS)",
            labFormat = labelFormat(suffix = "$"),
            opacity = 0.8,
            na.label = "No data")
```


See `leaflet.R` for standalone code.

## Sharing 

### Saving plotly/ggplotly objects

* Plotly/ggplotly objects are also **htmlwidgets** so any methods used for saving **htmlwidgets** also works for plotly/ggplotly objects: 
  * Saving and embedding HTML: `htmlwidgets::saveWidget()` function (also works for leaflet, DT, etc.)
  * Exporting static images: `orca()` as .svg or .pdf 

### Combining multiple views

#### Arranging multiple graphs 
```{r warning = F, message = F}
p1 <- plot_ly(nfl_qbr, x = ~total_epa, y = ~qbr_total) %>% 
  add_lines(name = "qbr total")

p2 <- plot_ly(nfl_qbr, x = ~total_epa, y = ~qb_plays) %>% 
  add_lines(name = "qb plays")

subplot(p1, p2, shareX = T)
```

#### Animation to combine multiple plots 
```{r warning = F, message = F}
gg <- nfl_qbr %>%
  filter(team %in% c("ARI", "ATL", "CHI", "CAR", "DAL")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = total_epa, y = qbr_total, color = team)) +
  geom_point(aes(frame = game_week)) 

ggplotly(gg)
```

### Arranging multiple views 

Since plotly objects are also **htmlwidgets**, any method that works for arranging htmlwidgets also works for plotly objects. 

Common ways to arrange components in a single web-page:

1. flexdashboard: An R package for arranging components into an opinionated dashboard layout. This package is essentially a special rmarkdown template that uses a simple markup syntax to define the layout.

2. Bootstrap’s grid layout: Both the **crosstalk** and **shiny** packages provide ways to arrange numerous components via Bootstrap’s (a popular HTML/CSS framework) grid layout system.

3. CSS flexbox: If you know some HTML and CSS, you can leverage CSS flexbox to arrange components via the **htmltools** package.

```{r echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/atoumi/Desktop/Graphics/figs/sharing.png")
```

We'll see how crosstalk, flexdashboard and DT work together with `Demo.Rmd` script. We'll also see a Shiny app with the `app.R` script.

## Lessons learned 

- The amount of interactive techniques is overwhelming
- Focus should be on identifying an analysis task/question first
- There will be different ways of doing the same thing, pick the most sensible to you 

Ideally, according to Carson Sievert: 

Go for R packages/technologies for creating interactive web graphics which:

- Don't require knowledge of web technologies (start-up cost)
- Produce standalone HTML whenever possible (hosting/maintenance cost)
- Work well with other "tidy" tools in R (iteration cost)
- Link to external vis libraries (startover cost)
- Easy to use interactive techniques that support data analysis tasks (discovery cost)
